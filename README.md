# Installing Git

## For Ubuntu

In the Terminal:

```
sudo apt-get install git
```

## For Windows

[Get here your installer](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

Recommendations:

* Check the option for using Git from the CMD, but also installing the bash.
* Install it with nano, **NOT VIM**

**If you aren't completely sure when installing it, be at the first session early, so I can guide you through the installation.**
